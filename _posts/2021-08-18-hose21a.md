title: A Recursive Formulation of Possibilistic Filters
abstract: We derive a recursive formulation of possibilistic filters that allow inference
  on the states in non-linear time-discrete dynamical systems in the presence of both
  aleatory and epistemic uncertainty with an imprecise probabilistic interpretation,
  and we present a particle-based implementation thereof.
