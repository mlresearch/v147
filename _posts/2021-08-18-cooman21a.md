title: 'Randomness and Imprecision: A Discussion of Recent Results'
abstract: 'We discuss our recent work on incorporating imprecision in the field of
  algorithmic randomness, based on the martingale-theoretic approach of game-theoretic
  probability. We consider several notions of randomness associated with interval,
  rather than precise, forecasting systems. We study their properties and argue that
  there are quite a number of reasons for wanting to do so. First, the richer mathematical
  structure in this generalisation provides a useful backdrop for a better understanding
  of precise randomness. Second, randomness associated with non-stationary precise
  forecasting systems can be captured by a constant but less precise interval forecast:
  greater model simplicity requires more imprecision. Third, imprecise randomness
  canâ€™t always be explained away as a result of (over)simplification: there are sequences
  that are random for a constant interval forecast, but never random for any computable
  (more) precise forecasting system. Incorporating imprecision into randomness therefore
  allows us to do more than was hitherto possible. Finally, the random sequences for
  a non-vacuous interval forecast constitute a meagre set, as they do for precise
  forecasts: imprecise and precise random sequences are equally rare from a topological
  point of view, and are, in that sense, equally interesting.'
