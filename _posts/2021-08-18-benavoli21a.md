title: Quantum Indistinguishability through Exchangeable Desirable Gambles
abstract: Two particles are identical if all their intrinsic properties, such as spin
  and charge, are the same, meaning that no quantum experiment can distinguish them.
  In addition to the well known principles of quantum mechanics, understanding systems
  of identical particles requires a new postulate, the so called <em>symmetrization
  postulate</em>. In this work, we show that the postulate corresponds to exchangeability
  assessments for sets of observables (gambles) in a quantum experiment, when quantum
  mechanics is seen as a normative and algorithmic theory guiding an agent to assess
  her subjective beliefs represented as (coherent) sets of gambles. Finally, we show
  how sets of exchangeable observables (gambles) may be updated after a measurement
  and discuss the issue of defining entanglement for indistinguishable particle systems.
