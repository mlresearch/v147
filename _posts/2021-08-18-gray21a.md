title: Dependent Possibilistic Arithmetic using Copulas
abstract: We describe two functions on possibility distributions which allow one to
  compute binary operations with dependence either specified by a copula or partially
  defined by an imprecise copula. We use the fact that possibility distributions are
  consonant belief functions to aggregate two possibility distributions into a bivariate
  belief function using a version of Sklar’s theorem for minitive belief functions,
  i.e. necessity measures. The results generalise previously published independent
  and Fréchet methods, allowing for any stochastic dependence to be specified in the
  form of a (imprecise) copula. This new method produces tighter extensions than previous
  methods when a precise copula is used. These latest additions to possibilistic arithmetic
  give it the same capabilities as p-box arithmetic, and provides a basis for a p-box/possibility
  hybrid arithmetic. This combined arithmetic provides tighter bounds on the exact
  upper and lower probabilities than either method alone for the propagation of general
  belief functions.
