title: Basic Probability Assignments Representable via Belief Intervals for Singletons
  in Dempster-Shafer Theory
abstract: Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) or Evidence theory has been commonly employed
  in the literature to deal with uncertainty-based information. The basis of this
  theory is the concept of basic probability assignment (BPA). The belief intervals
  for singletons obtained from a BPA have recently received considerable attention
  for quantifying uncertainty in DST. Indeed, they are easier to manage than the corresponding
  BPA to represent uncertainty-based information. Nonetheless, the set of probability
  distributions consistent with a BPA is smaller than the one compatible with the
  corresponding belief intervals for singletons. In this research, we give a new characterization
  of BPAs representable by belief intervals for singletons. Such a characterization
  might be easier to check than the one provided in previous works. In practical applications,
  this result allows efficiently knowing when uncertainty can be represented via belief
  intervals for singletons rather than the associated BPA without loss of information.
