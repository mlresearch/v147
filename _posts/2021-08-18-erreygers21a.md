title: Extending the Domain of Imprecise Jump Processes from Simple Variables to Measurable
  Ones
abstract: We extend the domain of imprecise jump processes, also known as imprecise
  continuous-time Markov chains, from inferences that depend on a finite number of
  time points to inferences that can depend on the state of the system at <em>all</em>
  time points. We also investigate the continuity properties of the resulting lower
  and upper expectations with respect to point-wise convergent sequences that are
  monotone or dominated. For two particular inferences, integrals over time and the
  number of jumps to a subset of states, we strengthen these continuity properties
  and present an iterative scheme to approximate their lower and upper expectations.
