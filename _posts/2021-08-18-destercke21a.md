title: 'Processing Multiple Distortion Models: a Comparative Study'
abstract: When dealing with uncertain information, distortion or neighbourhood models
  are convenient practical tools, as they rely on very few parameters. In this paper,
  we study their behaviour when such models are combined and processed. More specifically,
  we study their behaviour when merging different distortion models quantifying uncertainty
  on the same quantity, and when manipulating distortion models defined over multiple
  variables.
