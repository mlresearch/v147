title: Total Evidence and Learning with Imprecise Probabilities
abstract: 'In dynamic learning, a rational agent must revise their credence about
  a question of interest in accordance with the total evidence available between the
  earlier and later times. We discuss situations in which an observable event $F$
  that is sufficient for the total evidence can be identified, yet its probabilistic
  modeling cannot be performed in a precise manner. The agent may employ imprecise
  (IP) models of reasoning to account for the identified sufficient event, and perform
  change of credence or sequential decisions accordingly. Our proposal is illustrated
  with three case studies: the classic Monty Hall problem, statistical inference with
  non-ignorable missing data, and the use of forward induction in a two-person sequential
  game.'
