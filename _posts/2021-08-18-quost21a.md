title: Decision-making from Partial Instances by Active Feature Querying
abstract: 'We consider a classification problem in which test instances are not available
  as complete feature vectors, but must rather be uncovered by repeated queries to
  an oracle. We have a limited budget of queries: the problem is then to find the
  best features to ask the oracle for. We consider here a strategy where features
  are uncovered one by one, so as to maximize the separation between the classes.
  Once an instance has been uncovered, the distribution of the remaining instances
  is updated according to the observation. Experiments on synthetic and real data
  show that our strategy remains reasonably accurate when a decision must be made
  based on a limited amount of observed features. We briefly discuss the case of imprecise
  answers, and list out the many problems arising in this case.'
