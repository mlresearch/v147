title: 'Cautious Random Forests: a New Decision Strategy and some Experiments'
abstract: Random forest is an accurate classification strategy, which estimates the
  posterior probabilities of the classes by averaging frequencies provided by trees.
  When data are scarce, this estimation becomes difficult. The Imprecise Dirichlet
  Model can be used to make the estimation robust, providing intervals of probabilities
  as outputs. Here, we propose a new aggregation strategy based on the theory of belief
  functions. We also propose to assign weights to the trees according to their amount
  of uncertainty when classifying a new instance. Our approach is compared experimentally
  to the baseline approach on several datasets.
