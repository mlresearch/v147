title: A Remarkable Equivalence between Non-Stationary Precise and Stationary Imprecise
  Uncertainty Models in Computable Randomness
abstract: The field of algorithmic randomness studies what it means for infinite binary
  sequences to be random for some given uncertainty model. Classically, such randomness
  involves precise uncertainty models, and it is only recently that imprecision has
  been introduced into this field. As a consequence, the investigation into how imprecision
  alters our view on random sequences has only just begun. In this contribution, we
  establish a close and surprising connection between precise and imprecise uncertainty
  models in this randomness context. In particular, we show that there are stationary
  imprecise models and non-stationary precise models that have the exact same set
  of computably random sequences. We also discuss the possible implications of this
  result for a statistics based on imprecise probabilities.
