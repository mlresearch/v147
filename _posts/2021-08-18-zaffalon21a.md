title: The Sure Thing
abstract: 'If we prefer action $a$ to $b$ both under an event and under its complement,
  then we should just prefer $a$ to $b$. This is Savage’s <em>sure-thing principle</em>.
  In spite of its intuitive- and simple-looking nature, for which it gets almost immediate
  acceptance, the sure thing is not a logical principle. So where does it get its
  support from? In fact, the sure thing may actually fail. This is related to a variety
  of deep and foundational concepts in causality, decision theory, and probability,
  as well as to Simpsons’ paradox and Blyth’s game. In this paper we try to systematically
  clarify such a network of relations. Then we propose a general desirability theory
  for nonlinear utility scales. We use that to show that the sure thing is primitive
  to many of the previous concepts: In non-causal settings, the sure thing follows
  from considerations of temporal coherence and coincides with conglomerability; it
  can be understood as a rationality axiom to enable well-behaved conditioning in
  logic. In causal settings, it can be derived using only coherence and a causal independence
  condition.'
