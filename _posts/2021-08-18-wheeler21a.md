title: Discounting Desirable Gambles
abstract: The desirable gambles framework offers the most comprehensive foundations
  for the theory of lower previsions, which in turn affords the most general account
  of imprecise probabilities. Nevertheless, for all its generality, the theory of
  lower previsions rests on the notion of linear utility. This commitment to linearity
  is clearest in the coherence axioms for sets of desirable gambles. This paper considers
  two routes to relaxing this commitment. The first preserves the additive structure
  of the desirable gambles framework and the machinery for coherent inference but
  detaches the interpretation of desirability from the multiplicative scale invariance
  axiom. The second strays from the additive combination axiom to accommodate repeated
  gambles that return rewards by a non-stationary processes that is not necessarily
  additive. Unlike the first approach, which is a conservative amendment to the desirable
  gambles framework, the second is a radical departure. Yet, common to both is a method
  for describing rewards called <em>discounted utility</em>.
