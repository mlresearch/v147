title: Distributionally Robust, Skeptical Binary Inferences in Multi-label Problems
abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of making distributionally robust,
  skeptical inferences for the multi-label problem, or more generally for Boolean
  vectors. By distributionally robust, we mean that we consider sets of probability
  distributions, and by skeptical we understand that we consider as valid only those
  inferences that are true for every distribution within this set. Such inferences
  will provide partial predictions whenever the considered set is sufficiently big.
  We study in particular the Hamming loss case, a common loss function in multi-label
  problems, showing how skeptical inferences can be made in this setting. We also
  perform some experiments demonstrating the interest of our results.
