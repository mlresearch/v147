title: Stochastic Optimization for Numerical Evaluation of Imprecise Probabilities
abstract: In applications of imprecise probability, analysts must compute lower (or
  upper) expectations, defined as the infimum of an expectation over a set of parameter
  values. Monte Carlo methods consistently approximate expectations at fixed parameter
  values, but can be costly to implement in grid search to locate minima over large
  subsets of the parameter space. We investigate the use of stochastic iterative root-finding
  methods for efficiently computing lower expectations. In two examples we illustrate
  the use of various stochastic approximation methods, and demonstrate their superior
  performance in comparison to grid search.
