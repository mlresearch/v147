title: Improving Algorithms for Decision Making with the Hurwicz Criterion
abstract: We propose two improved algorithms for evaluating the Hurwicz criterion
  in the context of decision making with lower previsions, along with a new benchmarking
  algorithm for measuring these improvements. The Hurwicz criterion is a well-known
  criterion for decision making with lower previsions under severe uncertainty when
  decision makers want to balance between pessimistic and optimistic extremes. When
  the domain of the lower prevision, the set of possible outcomes and the set of possible
  decisions are all finite, the classic method for applying this criterion goes by
  solving a sequence of linear programs. We show how to improve this classic algorithm,
  based on similar improvements that we have proposed for other decision criteria.
  Additionally, to allow benchmarking these improvements, we provide a new algorithm
  for randomly generating artificial decision problems with a set number of Hurwicz
  gambles. In our simulation, our proposed algorithms for Hurwicz outperform the standard
  algorithm in most scenarios except when the set of outcomes is small, the domain
  of the lower prevision is large, and there are many Hurwicz optimal decisions at
  once, in which case our proposed algorithms are slightly slower.
