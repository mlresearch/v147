title: 'Global Upper Expectations for Discrete-Time Stochastic Processes: In Practice,
  They Are All The Same!'
abstract: 'We consider three different types of global uncertainty models for discrete-time
  stochastic processes: measure-theoretic upper expectations, game-theoretic upper
  expectations and axiomatic upper expectations. The last two are known to be identical.
  We show that they coincide with measure-theoretic upper expectations on two distinct
  domains: monotone pointwise limits of finitary gambles, and bounded below Borel-measurable
  variables. We argue that these domains cover most practical inferences, and that
  therefore, in practice, it does not matter which model is used.'
