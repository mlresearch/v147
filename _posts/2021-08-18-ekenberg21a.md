title: Probabilistic Risk Management in Project Portfolios
abstract: We discuss a novel method for business risk handling in project portfolios
  under strong uncertainty, where we utilise event trees including adverse consequences
  together with mitigation costs and expected effects, where consequence and event
  probabilities and costs are represented by random parameters. The method has been
  developed to support large-scale real-life applications of portfolio risk management,
  where the properties of the probabilities and values are entered by domain experts
  with often very limited knowledge of probability theory, and we demonstrate how
  this can be accomplished with minor information loss. The method is currently in
  use in one of the worldâ€™s largest telecom equipment manufacturers which has a vast
  project portfolio of tenders, with each successful tender subsequently becoming
  an order in the order book portfolio.
