title: Computing Simple Bounds for Regression Estimates for Linear Regression with
  Interval-valued Covariates
abstract: 'In this paper, we deal with linear regression where the covariates are
  interval-valued and the dependent variable is precise. Opposed to the case where
  the dependent variable is interval-valued and the covariates are precise, it is
  far more difficult to compute the set of all ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates
  as the precise values of the covariates vary over all possible values, compatible
  with the given intervals of the covariates. Though the exact solution is difficult
  to obtain, there are still some simple possibilities to compute bounds for the regression
  parameters. In this paper we deal with simple linear regression and present three
  different approaches: The first one uses a simple interval-arithmetic consideration
  for the equation for the slope parameter. The second approach uses reverse regression
  to swap the roles of the dependent and the independent variable to make the computation
  analytically solvable. The obtained solution for the reverse regression then gives
  an analytical upper bound for the slope parameter of the original regression. The
  third approach does not directly give bounds for the OLS estimator. Instead, before
  the actual interval analysis, in a first step, we modify the OLS estimator to another
  linear estimator which is simply a reasonably weighted convex combination of a number
  of unbiased estimators, which are themselves based on only two data points of the
  data set, respectively. It turns out that for the degenerate case of a precise independent
  variable, this estimator coincides with the OLS estimator. Additionally, the third
  method does also work if both the independent variable, as well as the dependent
  variable are interval-valued. Also the case of more than one covariate is manageable.
  A further nice point is that because of the analytical accessibility of the third
  estimator, also confidence intervals for the bounds can be established. To compare
  all three approaches, we conduct a short simulation study.'
