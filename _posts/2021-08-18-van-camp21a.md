title: Independent Natural Extension for Choice Functions
abstract: We investigate epistemic independence for choice functions in a multivariate
  setting. This work is a continuation of earlier work of one of the authors [23],
  and our results build on the characterization of choice functions in terms of sets
  of binary preferences recently established by De Bock and De Cooman [7]. We obtain
  the independent natural extension in this framework. Given the generality of choice
  functions, our expression for the independent natural extension is the most general
  one we are aware of, and we show how it implies the independent natural extension
  for sets of desirable gambles, and therefore also for less informative imprecise-probabilistic
  models. Once this is in place, we compare this concept of epistemic independence
  to another independence concept for choice functions proposed by Seidenfeld [22],
  which De Bock and De Cooman [1]:S-independence have called S-independence. We show
  that neither is more general than the other.
