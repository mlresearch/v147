title: An Imprecise Bayesian Approach to Thermal Runaway Probability
abstract: In this pioneering work, an assessment of thermal runaway probability based
  on simplified <em>chemical kinetics</em> has been performed with imprecise Bayesian
  methods relying on several priors. The physical phenomenon is governed by two chemical
  kinetic parameters $A$ and $Ea$. We suppose that their values are considerably uncertain
  but also that we know the experimental profiles of a chemical species corresponding
  to their true values, thereby allowing us to compute likelihoods and posteriors
  corresponding to different levels of information. We are interested in the critical
  delay time $tc$ beyond which an explosion will certainly occur. The use of several
  priors allows us to see when the data truly dominate the prior with respect to the
  probability distribution of $tc$. It does not appear possible to do so in an orthodox
  precise Bayesian framework that reduces all forms of uncertainty to a single probability
  distribution.
