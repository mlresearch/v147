title: Constructing Consonant Predictive Beliefs from Data with Scenario Theory
abstract: A method for constructing consonant predictive beliefs for multivariate
  datasets is presented. We make use of recent results in scenario theory to construct
  a family of enclosing sets that are associated with a predictive lower probability
  of new data falling in each given set. We show that the sequence of lower bounds
  indexed by enclosing set yields a consonant belief function. The presented method
  does not rely on the construction of a likelihood function, therefore possibility
  distributions can be obtained without the need for normalization. We present a practical
  example in two dimensions for the sake of visualization, to demonstrate the practical
  procedure of obtaining the sequence of nested sets.
