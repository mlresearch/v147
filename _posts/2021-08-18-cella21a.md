title: Valid Inferential Models for Prediction in Supervised Learning Problems
abstract: Prediction, where observed data is used to quantify uncertainty about a
  future observation, is a fundamental problem in statistics. Prediction sets with
  coverage probability guarantees are a common solution, but these do not provide
  probabilistic uncertainty quantification in the sense of assigning beliefs to relevant
  assertions about the future observable. Alternatively, we recommend the use of a
  <em>probabilistic predictor</em>, a fully-specified (imprecise) probability distribution
  for the to-be-predicted observation given the observed data. It is essential that
  the probabilistic predictor is reliable or valid in some sense, and here we offer
  a notion of validity and explore its implications. We also provide a general inferential
  model construction that yields a provably valid probabilistic predictor, with illustrations
  in regression and classification.
