title: Towards Improving Electoral Forecasting by Including Undecided Voters and Interval-valued
  Prior Knowledge
abstract: Increasing numbers of undecided voters constitute a severe challenge for
  conventional pre-election polls in multi-party systems. While these polls only provide
  the still pondering individuals with the options to either state a precise party
  or to drop out, we suggest to regard their valuable information in a set-valued
  way. The resulting consideration set, listing all the options the individual is
  still pondering between, can be interpreted under epistemic imprecision. Within
  this paper we extend the already existing approaches including this valuable information,
  by making first steps to utilize interval-valued prior information. Including background
  information is common in election forecasting while we focus on realistically obtainable
  and credible interval-valued prior information about transition probabilities from
  the undecided to the eventual choice. We introduce two approaches utilizing this
  interval-valued information, weighting the credibility against the precision of
  the results. For the first approach, we narrow the most cautious and wide so-called
  Dempster bounds by deploying the prior information on the transition probabilities
  as new worst and best case scenarios for each party. The second approach applies
  if these interval-valued results are still too wide for useful application. We hereby
  narrow them towards a good guess of the eventual choice, estimated by a further
  model-based source of information making use of the covariates. These single-valued
  estimates on the individual level are regarded as realizations of an underlying
  probability distribution, which we combine with the prior knowledge in a Bayesian
  way. The approach can thus be seen as an attempt to combine two, for the needed
  outcome by themselves inadequate, sources of information to obtain more concise
  results. We conduct a simulation study showing the applicability and virtues of
  the new approaches and compare them to conventional ones.
