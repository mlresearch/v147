title: 'Using Credal C4.5 for Calibrated Label Ranking in Multi-Label Classification '
abstract: The Multi-Label Classification (MLC) task aims to predict the set of labels
  that correspond to an instance. It differs from traditional classification, which
  assumes that each instance has associated a single value of a class variable. Within
  MLC, the Calibrated Label Ranking algorithm (CLR) considers a binary classification
  problem for each pair of labels to determine a label ranking for a given instance,
  exploiting in this way correlations between pairs of labels. Moreover, CLR mitigates
  the class imbalance problem that frequently appears in MLC motivated by the fact
  that, in MLC, there are usually very few instances that have associated a certain
  label. For solving the binary classification problems, a traditional classification
  algorithm is needed. The C4.5 algorithm, based on Decision Trees, has been widely
  employed in this domain. In this work, we show that the Credal C4.5 method, a version
  of C4.5 recently proposed that uses imprecise probabilities, is more suitable than
  C4.5 for solving the binary classification problems in CLR. An exhaustive experimental
  analysis carried out in this research shows that Credal C4.5 performs better than
  C4.5 when both algorithms are employed in CLR, being the improvement more notable
  as there is more noise in the labels.
