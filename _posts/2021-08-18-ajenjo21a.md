title: An Info-gap Framework for Comparing Epistemic Uncertainty Models in Hybrid
  Structural Reliability Analysis
abstract: The main objective of this work is to study the effect of the choice of
  the input uncertainty model on robustness evaluations of probabilities of failure.
  Aleatory and epistemic uncertainty are jointly propagated by considering hybrid
  models and applying random set theory. The notion of horizon of uncertainty found
  in the info-gap theory, which is usually used to assess the robustness of a model
  to uncertainty, allows the bounds on the failure probability obtained from different
  epistemic uncertainty models to be compared at increasing levels of uncertainty.
  Info-gap robustness and opportuneness curves are obtained and compared considering
  the interval model, triangular and trapezoidal possibility distributions, the probabilistic
  uniform distribution and the paralellepiped convex model on two toy cases. A specific
  demand value, as introduced in the info-gap theory, is used as a value of information
  metric to quantify the gain of information on the probability of failure between
  a less informative uncertainty model and a more informative one.
