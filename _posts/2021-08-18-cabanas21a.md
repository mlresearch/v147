title: 'CREPO: An Open Repository to Benchmark Credal Network Algorithms'
abstract: Credal networks are a popular class of imprecise probabilistic graphical
  models obtained as a Bayesian network generalization based on, so-called <em>credal</em>,
  sets of probability mass functions. A Java library called CREMA has been recently
  released to model, process and query credal networks. Despite the NP-hardness of
  the (exact) task, a number of algorithms is available to approximate credal network
  inferences. In this paper we present CREPO, an open repository of synthetic credal
  networks, provided together with the exact results of inference tasks on these models.
  A Python tool is also delivered to load these data and interact with CREMA, thus
  making extremely easy to evaluate and compare existing and novel inference algorithms.
  To demonstrate such benchmarking scheme, we propose an approximate heuristic to
  be used inside variable elimination schemes to keep a bound on the maximum number
  of vertices generated during the combination step. A CREPO-based validation against
  approximate procedures based on linearization and exact techniques performed in
  CREMA is finally discussed.
