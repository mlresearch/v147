title: Robust Model Checking with Imprecise Markov Reward Models
abstract: In recent years probabilistic model checking has become an important area
  of research because of the diffusion of computational systems of stochastic nature.
  Despite its great success, standard probabilistic model checking suffers the limitation
  of requiring a sharp specification of the probabilities governing the model behaviour.
  The theory of imprecise probabilities offers a natural approach to overcome such
  limitation by a sensitivity analysis with respect to the values of these parameters.
  However, only extensions based on discrete-time imprecise Markov chains have been
  considered so far for such a robust approach to model checking. We present a further
  extension based on imprecise Markov reward models. In particular, we derive efficient
  algorithms to compute lower and upper bounds of the expected cumulative reward and
  probabilistic bounded rewards based on existing results for imprecise Markov chains.
  These ideas are tested on a real case study involving the spend-down costs of geriatric
  medicine departments.
