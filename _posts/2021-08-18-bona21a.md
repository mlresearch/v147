title: Epistemic Argumentation with Conditional Probabilities and Labeling Constraints
abstract: We extend epistemic graphs, a powerful representation language employed
  in argumentation theory, first, by allowing conditional probabilities in that language.
  We also offer a new way of interpreting the graph as a set of restrictions based
  on a selected semantics for the abstract argumentation frameworks. The resulting
  semantics for epistemic graphs are given by credal sets that we characterize through
  inequalities. We illustrate the main issues in our proposals by resorting to arguments
  related to climate change.
