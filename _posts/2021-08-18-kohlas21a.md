title: Information Algebras of Coherent Sets of Gambles in General Possibility Spaces
abstract: In this paper, we show that coherent sets of gambles can be embedded into
  the algebraic structure of <em>information algebra</em>. This leads firstly, to
  a new perspective of the algebraic and logical structure of desirability and secondly,
  it connects desirability, hence imprecise probabilities, to other formalism in computer
  science sharing the same underlying structure. Both the <em>domain-free</em> and
  the <em>labeled</em> view of the information algebra of coherent sets of gambles
  are presented, considering general possibility spaces.
