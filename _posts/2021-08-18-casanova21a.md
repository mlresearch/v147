title: Nonlinear Desirability as a Linear Classification Problem
abstract: The present paper proposes a generalization of linearity axioms of coherence
  through a geometrical approach, which leads to an alternative interpretation of
  desirability as a <em>classification problem</em>. In particular, we analyze different
  sets of rationality axioms and, for each one of them, we show that proving that
  a subject, who provides finite accept and reject statements, respects these axioms,
  corresponds to solving a binary classification task using, each time, a different
  (usually nonlinear) family of classifiers. Moreover, by borrowing ideas from machine
  learning, we show the possibility to define a <em>feature mapping</em> allowing
  us to reformulate the above nonlinear classification problems as linear ones in
  a higher-dimensional space. This allows us to interpret gambles directly as payoffs
  vectors of <em>monetary lotteries</em>, as well as to reduce the task of proving
  the rationality of a subject to a linear classification task.
