title: Towards a Theory of Confidence in Market-Based Predictions
abstract: Prediction markets are a way to yield probabilistic predictions about future
  events, theoretically incorporating all available information. In this paper, we
  focus on the <em>confidence</em> that we should place in the prediction of a market.
  When should we believe that the market probability meaningfully reflects underlying
  uncertainty, and when should we not? We discuss two notions of confidence. The first
  is based on the expected profit that a trader could make from correcting the market
  if it were wrong, and the second is based on expected market volatility in the future.
  Our paper is a stepping stone to future work in this area, and we conclude by discussing
  some key challenges.
