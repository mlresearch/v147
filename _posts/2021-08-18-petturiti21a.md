title: Betting Schemes for Assessing Coherent Numerical and Comparative Conditional
  Possibilities
abstract: We introduce coherence conditions having a betting scheme interpretation
  both for a numerical and a comparative conditional possibility assessment. The conditional
  bets are considered under partially resolving uncertainty and assuming consonance.
  This means that we allow situations in which the agent may only acquire the information
  that a non-impossible event occurs, without knowing which is the true state of the
  world. Further, he/she can only consider families of nested non-impossible events
  in computing the gain and has a systematically optimistic behavior. Both conditions
  are proved to be equivalent to the existence of a conditional possibility agreeing
  with an axiomatic definition based on the algebraic product t-norm, that extends,
  either numerically or comparatively (through the induced comparative conditional
  possibility relation), the given assessment.
