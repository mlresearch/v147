title: 'Average Behaviour of Imprecise Markov Chains: A Single Pointwise Ergodic Theorem
  for Six Different Models'
abstract: We study the average behaviour of imprecise Markov chains; a generalised
  type of Markov chain where local probabilities are partially specified, and where
  structural assumptions such as Markovianity are weakened. In particular, we prove
  a pointwise ergodic theorem that provides (strictly) almost sure bounds on the long
  term average of any real function of the state of such an imprecise Markov chain.
  Compared to an earlier ergodic theorem by De Cooman et al. (2006), our result requires
  weaker conditions, provides tighter bounds, and applies to six different types of
  models.
