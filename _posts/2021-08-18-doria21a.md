title: Credal sets of Coherent Conditional Probabilities Defined by Hausdorff Measures
abstract: Credal sets containing coherent conditional probabilities defined by Hausdorff
  measures on the Borel sigma-field of metric spaces with bi-Lipschitz equivalent
  metrics, are proven to represent merging opinions with increasing information.
