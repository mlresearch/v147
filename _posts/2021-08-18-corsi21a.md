title: When Belief Functions and Lower Probabilities are Indistinguishable
abstract: This paper reports on a geometrical investigation of de Finetti’s Dutch
  Book method as an operational foundation for a wide range of generalisations of
  probability measures, including lower probabilities, necessity measures and belief
  functions. Our main result identifies a number of non-limiting circumstances under
  which de Finetti’s coherence fails to lift from less to more general models. In
  particular our result shows that rich enough sets of events exist such that the
  coherence criteria for belief functions and lower probability collapse.
