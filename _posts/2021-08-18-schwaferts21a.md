title: Imprecise Hypothesis-Based Bayesian Decision Making with Composite Hypotheses
abstract: Statistical analyses with composite hypotheses are omnipresent in empirical
  sciences, and a decision-theoretic account is required in order to formally consider
  their practical relevance. A Bayesian hypothesis-based decision-theoretic analysis
  requires the specification of a prior distribution, the hypotheses, and a loss function,
  and determines the optimal decision by minimizing the expected posterior loss of
  each hypothesis. However, specifying such a decision problem unambiguously is rather
  difficult as, typically, the relevant information is available only partially. In
  order to include such incomplete information into the analysis and to facilitate
  the use of decision-theoretic approaches in applied sciences, this paper extends
  the framework of hypothesis-based Bayesian decision making with composite hypotheses
  into the framework of imprecise probabilities, such that imprecise specifications
  for the prior distribution, for the composite hypotheses, and for the loss function
  are allowed. Imprecisely specified composite hypotheses are sets of parameter sets
  that are able to incorporate blurring borders between hypotheses into the analysis.
  The imprecisely specified prior distribution gets updated via generalized Bayes
  rule, such that imprecise probabilities of the (imprecise) hypotheses can be calculated.
  These lead – together with the (imprecise) loss function – to a set-valued expected
  posterior loss for finding the optimal decision. Beneficially, the result will also
  indicate whether or not the available information is sufficient to guide the decision
  unambiguously, without pretending a level of precision that is not available.
